        CHALLENGE INSTRUCTIONS:
        1. Create a main heading (h1) with text "HTML Basics"
        2. Add a subheading (h2) with text "Headings"
        3. Under the "Headings" subheading, create all 6 levels of headings (h1-h6)
           with text showing their level (e.g., "This is an h1")
        4. Add another subheading (h2) with text "Paragraphs"
        5. Under the "Paragraphs" subheading, create three paragraphs (p) with:
           - First paragraph: "This is a short paragraph."
           - Second paragraph: "This is a medium length paragraph with some more text to demonstrate how paragraphs work in HTML."
           - Third paragraph: "This is a longer paragraph. It contains multiple sentences to show how text flows in a paragraph element. Paragraphs are block-level elements that typically contain text content and other inline elements."
        6. Add proper spacing between elements for readability
