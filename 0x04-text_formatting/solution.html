    <h1>Text Formatting Examples</h1>

    <p>
        This paragraph demonstrates various text formatting options.
        <strong>This text is strongly emphasized</strong>, while
        <em>this text is simply emphasized</em>. Here we have some
        <mark>highlighted or marked as important</mark> text.
        Sometimes we need to show <del>deleted or strikethrough</del> text.
        Scientific notation might require H<sub>2</sub>O or E=mc<sup>2</sup>.
    </p>

    <blockquote cite="https://www.example.com">
        "This is an important quote that needs to stand out from the regular text."
