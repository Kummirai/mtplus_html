        CHALLENGE INSTRUCTIONS:
        1. Create a navigation menu with 3 links:
           - "Home" that links to "#home"
           - "About" that links to "#about"
           - "Contact" that links to "#contact"

        2. Below the menu, create a paragraph with text:
           "Visit our partner site"
           where "partner site" is a link to "https://example.com"
           that opens in a new tab

        3. Add an email link with text "Email us"
           that opens the user's email client to send an email to "info@example.com"

        4. Create a clickable image that links to "https://www.google.com/"
           Use any image you like (you can use https://placeholder.com/150 for a placeholder)
